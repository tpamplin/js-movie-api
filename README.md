# js-movie-app

An app that serves up information about different Movies, Genres, and Directors.
Create a new user, login, and then you can request details on all movies in the database or just one specific movie. You can also request information about a specific genre or director. Once you find the movie you are looking for, you can add it to your favorites list to make it easy to find later! Finally, you can change your username, or delete your account.

For more information on how to request data from the api, visit the documentation: https://myflix-timpamplin-021f285e4632.herokuapp.com/documentation.html

Written in Javascript with Node.JS and Express, hosted with Heroku. The database is a non-relational json database made with MongoDB and hosted with MongoDB Atlas.
